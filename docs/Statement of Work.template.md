## 1. Purpose and Overview



---

## 2. Scope of Work

### 2.1 In-Scope

List the specific deliverables, features, or services to be provided.
Example:

* Develop a RESTful API for customer registration.
* Implement frontend UI with React and TailwindCSS.
* Integrate CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker.

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope

Clarify what is *not* included in this engagement to avoid scope creep.
Example:

* Mobile app implementation.
* Third-party license procurement.
* Production infrastructure costs.

## 3. Deliverables and Milestones

| # | Deliverable                | Description                       | Due Date   | Acceptance Criteria   |
| - | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1 | Requirements Specification | Approved PRD and system design    | YYYY-MM-DD | Signed-off document   |
| 2 | MVP Build                  | Working build deployed to staging | YYYY-MM-DD | Passes all test cases |
| 3 | Final Delivery             | Production-ready deployment       | YYYY-MM-DD | Client sign-off       |

---

## 4. Technical Approach

Describe the architectural and technological approach to be used in the project.

### 4.1 Tech Stack

* **Runtime:** Node.js 20.x / Python 3.12 / Java 21
* **Frameworks:** Next.js 15.x, NestJS 10.x, or Spring Boot 3.x
* **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.x
* **Infrastructure:** AWS (ECS, S3, RDS)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Docker

### 4.2 Development Methodology

Specify whether the project follows Agile, Kanban, or Waterfall. Include iteration length and review cadence.
Example: Two-week Agile sprints with demo reviews and backlog grooming.

---

## 5. Assumptions and Dependencies

List assumptions about data availability, client responsibilities, or environmental constraints.
Example:

* Client will provide AWS credentials and domain access.
* Dependencies on third-party APIs will be accessible during development.
* Stakeholders will review deliverables within 3 business days.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

Define how deliverables will be verified and accepted.
Example:

* Code must pass all automated tests with ≥95% coverage.
* Application must achieve <200ms latency under 1,000 concurrent users.
* Documentation must be complete and peer-reviewed.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role            | Responsibility                       | Assigned To   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Project Manager | Schedule, coordination, reporting    | [Name]        |
| Lead Developer  | Architecture, code quality           | [Name]        |
| QA Engineer     | Test automation, validation          | [Name]        |
| Product Owner   | Feature approval, business decisions | [Client/Name] |

---

## 8. Project Schedule

Provide a Gantt-style timeline or milestone-based schedule.
Example:

* Phase 1: Discovery and Requirements (2 weeks)
* Phase 2: Architecture and Design (3 weeks)
* Phase 3: Implementation and Testing (6 weeks)
* Phase 4: Deployment and Handover (2 weeks)

---

## 9. Payment Terms

Define the billing model—fixed price, time & materials, or milestone-based.
Example:

* 30% upon SOW approval
* 40% upon MVP delivery
* 30% upon final acceptance

---

## 10. Change Management

Specify the process for handling changes to requirements or scope.
Example:

* All changes must be documented via a Change Request Form (CRF).
* Approval by both parties required before implementation.

---

## 11. Risk Management

Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
Example:

| Risk                  | Impact | Mitigation                                |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| API provider downtime | High   | Implement retry logic and fallback cache  |
| Key staff turnover    | Medium | Maintain cross-training and documentation |

---

## 12. Confidentiality and Intellectual Property

State ownership of code, designs, and documentation upon project completion.
Example:
All deliverables produced under this SOW become the sole property of the Client upon full payment.

---

## 13. Signatures

| Party      | Name | Title | Signature | Date |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | --------- | ---- |
| Client     |      |       |           |      |
| Contractor |      |       |           |      |

Would you like me to tailor this for a **specific project type** (e.g., *web app*, *Unity game*, *AI pipeline*, *backend service*) and include the appropriate task breakdown and acceptance tests?
