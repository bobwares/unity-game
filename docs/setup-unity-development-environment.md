# Setup Unity Development Environment


## Overview
This guide walks a new Unity game developer through preparing their workstation, creating the required Unity account, and verifying core tooling (including Visual Studio) so they can start working on projects immediately.

## 1. Confirm Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 or macOS 12+. Ensure you have administrative rights to install software.
- **Hardware**: At least 16 GB RAM, a quad-core CPU, and a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1060/AMD RX 580 or better) for smooth editor performance.
- **Visual Studio**: Install the latest Visual Studio with the **Game development with Unity** workload. This provides the Unity-specific project tools, debugger integration, and C# support. Verify installation by launching Visual Studio and confirming the workload under **Tools ▸ Get Tools and Features**.
- **Microsoft .NET SDK (optional)**: Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for additional command-line tooling (formatters, analyzers, build pipelines).

## 2. Create a Unity ID
1. Navigate to [https://id.unity.com](https://id.unity.com) in a browser.
2. Click **Create a Unity ID**.
3. Enter your email address, set a secure password, and provide required profile details.
4. Review the Unity Terms of Service and privacy policy, then click **Create a Unity ID**.
5. Confirm your email address via the verification link sent by Unity.
6. Enable two-factor authentication (recommended) by visiting **id.unity.com ▸ Security** to protect access to organization assets and cloud services.

## 3. Install Unity Hub
1. Download Unity Hub from [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download).
2. Run the installer:
   - **Windows**: Execute the `.exe`, accept the license, and choose the default install path.
   - **macOS**: Mount the `.dmg` and drag **Unity Hub** into **Applications**.
3. Launch Unity Hub and sign in with your Unity ID.
4. Review privacy and diagnostic settings, adjusting telemetry options according to studio policy.
5. In **Preferences ▸ Licenses**, activate the appropriate license type (Personal, Plus, Pro, or Enterprise). Personal licenses require declaring revenue under the current eligibility threshold.

## 4. Install Unity Editor Versions
1. In Unity Hub, open the **Installs** tab and click **Add**.
2. Select the latest **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release unless a project specifies a different version.
3. Choose required build support modules:
   - **Windows**: Windows Build Support (IL2CPP) and additional platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) as needed.
   - **macOS**: macOS Build Support, and optional modules for target platforms.
4. Confirm component sizes and click **Install**. Installation may take 15–30 minutes depending on modules and network speed.
5. Repeat for any secondary versions required for legacy projects, keeping only the minimum necessary to reduce disk usage.

## 5. Configure Visual Studio for Unity
1. Open Visual Studio and sign in with your Microsoft account if prompted.
2. Verify the Unity workload was installed (see **Tools ▸ Get Tools and Features**). Add it if missing.
3. Confirm **Visual Studio Tools for Unity** is active under **Extensions ▸ Manage Extensions**. This extension provides integrated debugging (Attach Unity Debugger), IntelliSense for Unity APIs, and synchronized project file generation tailored to Unity projects.
4. Install recommended extensions:
   - **Unity Code Coverage** (optional) for test coverage visualization.
   - Additional productivity extensions used by your studio (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, code metrics).
5. Adjust editor preferences:
   - Set **Tools ▸ Options ▸ Environment ▸ Fonts and Colors** for your preferred theme.
   - Configure **Text Editor ▸ C#** settings such as code style and formatting.
6. Enable Unity project integration by opening any `.csproj` generated by Unity and confirming IntelliSense resolves Unity namespaces (`UnityEngine`, `UnityEditor`).

## 6. Connect Unity Hub to Visual Studio
1. Open Unity Hub and switch to the **Installs** tab.
2. Click the **⋮** menu next to the installed Unity Editor and select **Add modules**.
3. Confirm the **Microsoft Visual Studio** module is checked for Windows installations (macOS users rely on the external Visual Studio app).
4. In Unity Hub, go to **Preferences ▸ External Tools** and set:
   - **External Script Editor**: `Microsoft Visual Studio`.
   - **Generate all .csproj files**: Enabled for advanced solutions (optional).
   - **Embedded packages** and **Registry packages**: Checked if your workflow requires package source projects.
5. Apply changes and close Preferences. To verify the integration, open a script from Unity and ensure Visual Studio launches with the Unity Debugger status bar indicator visible, confirming the Visual Studio Tools for Unity extension is communicating with the editor.

## 7. Create a Baseline Unity Project
1. In Unity Hub, click **Projects ▸ New Project**.
2. Select the template that matches your target (e.g., **3D URP**, **2D**, **VR**).
3. Name the project, choose a location under version control (e.g., a Git repository), and click **Create Project**.
4. Once Unity Editor opens, confirm the **Console** window shows no errors.
5. From Unity, open **Edit ▸ Preferences ▸ External Tools** and verify Visual Studio is assigned as the script editor.
6. Double-click a script (e.g., `SampleScene` objects or create a new C# script) to ensure Visual Studio launches and attaches correctly.

## 8. Install Supporting Tools (Optional but Recommended)
- **Unity Version Control (Plastic SCM)**: Integrated version control for asset-heavy projects. Enable via the Unity Dashboard or install the Plastic client.
- **Git**: Install from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and configure with your preferred GUI (GitHub Desktop, SourceTree) if Plastic is not used.
- **Package Managers**: Set up npm, pip, or other ecosystem-specific tools if your project relies on web services, AI tools, or automation pipelines.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Install communication apps (Teams, Slack, Discord) and project trackers (Jira, Azure DevOps) per studio standards.

## 9. Validate the Environment
1. Open the baseline project in Unity and press **Play** to verify the editor runs scenes successfully.
2. In Visual Studio, set a breakpoint in a C# script and attach the debugger via **Debug ▸ Attach Unity Debugger**. Confirm breakpoints are hit during Play Mode.
3. Run **Assets ▸ Run Tests** (requires Unity Test Framework package) to ensure test integration works.
4. Perform a sample build via **File ▸ Build Settings** to validate platform modules and IL2CPP toolchains.
5. Document the installed versions (Unity Editor, Visual Studio, SDKs) for team tracking and reproducibility.

## 10. Keep the Environment Updated
- **Unity Hub**: Regularly check for new LTS patches and install them during scheduled maintenance windows.
- **Visual Studio**: Update via the Visual Studio Installer to receive bug fixes and new Unity tooling support.
- **Packages**: Use Unity's **Package Manager** to update verified packages while monitoring release notes for API changes.
- **Backups**: Snapshot critical settings (Unity preferences, Visual Studio `.vssettings`) and maintain version-controlled configuration files.

By completing these steps, the developer will have a robust Unity development environment linked to their Unity account and fully integrated with Visual Studio, ready for project work.
