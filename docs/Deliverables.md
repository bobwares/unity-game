## Deliverables

1.  Unity Addressables Assets **Application Implementation Pattern** 


The pattern provides guidance for structuring a game so players can install and begin playing within seconds. Only essential assets—menus, initial scenes, and the first playable area—are included in the base download.

All other content, such as extended environments, character models, or cinematic sequences, is organized into modular bundles that can be downloaded dynamically as the player progresses.

The pattern will include:

- Instructions on how the game developer accesses Addressable Assets in the game code and configuration.
- Guidance on how Unity Addressable Assets should be bundled in a way that minimizes initial download size, enables dynamic content loading, and supports continuous updates without full game republishing.
- The design of an Asset Publishing Pipeline 
- How they are cataloged and published.
- The pattern establishes guidance for integrating external **content creation studios** into the production process. Each participating studio follows shared conventions for asset structure, naming, and optimization, ensuring all submissions align with the technical and performance expectations of the main game project.
- define a Unity Addressable Assets Publishing Pipeline. 


**By following this pattern**, game developers achieve:

* Fast installation and immediate gameplay.
* Continuous background loading without interruption.
* Smaller app-store packages and faster acquisition rates.
* Flexible post-launch content updates without full re-release.
* {{add sections for content creator }}


2. Implementation of the Unity Addressable Assets Publishing Pipeline

The second deliverable is the **implementation of an Asset Publishing Pipeline**, which automates the process of building, validating, and distributing addressable asset bundles.

This pipeline operates independently of the main game source code through an **isolated Git repository** dedicated to asset production. External studios and internal art teams commit their content to this separate repository, keeping asset creation decoupled from game logic. The pipeline automatically builds, analyzes, and publishes validated assets for integration and release.

Key capabilities include:

* **Headless Unity Build Execution:** Automates bundle creation through command-line builds for repeatability and CI/CD integration.
* **Automated Bundle Analysis:** Detects missing references, duplicate dependencies, and inefficiencies before publishing.
* **Isolated Asset Repository Integration:** Enables independent asset submission and version tracking, preventing conflicts with the main game implementation repository.
* **AWS-Based Publishing and Distribution:** Publishes validated content to a scalable content delivery provider for global accessibility.
* **Versioned Release Management:** Maintains structured manifests and release metadata to support rollback, verification, and controlled deployment.

This pipeline is the operational core of the solution—it turns the pattern’s guidance into an automated process that enforces quality, ensures reproducibility, and enables distributed teams to publish assets safely and consistently for use in live or in-development games.
