+# Architecture Decision Record
+
+Document Remote Asset Loading Pattern
+
+**Turn**: 1
+
+**Status**: Accepted
+
+**Date**: 2025-10-18 - 16:11 UTC
+
+**Context**
+We need to capture a repeatable approach for delivering large, frequently changing Unity game assets from remote infrastructure without shipping a full client update.
+
+**Options Considered**
+- Store the pattern only in conversational history without repository documentation.
+- Create a concise markdown guide inside the project's docs directory summarizing the recommended architecture and workflow.
+
+**Decision**
+Create a dedicated markdown document under `docs/` that records the CDN-backed remote asset loading architecture, ensuring the guidance is versioned with the project and accessible to collaborators.
+
+**Result**
+Added `docs/remote-asset-loading-pattern.md` describing use cases, architecture, implementation steps, operations, and considerations for the pattern.
+
+**Consequences**
+- Positive: Team members have a discoverable, version-controlled reference for implementing remote asset delivery.
+- Positive: The pattern can evolve alongside future Unity tooling or infrastructure changes via pull requests.
+- Negative: Documentation must be maintained to stay aligned with future implementation details.

+# Remote Asset Loading Pattern for Unity Games
+
+## Use Case
+
+- **Scenario**: A live-service Unity game must deliver large textures, models, audio, and configuration files to players worldwide without forcing a full client patch each time content changes.
+- **Goals**:
+  - Keep the base application size small for faster installs and updates.
+  - Ship fresh content (for example, seasonal cosmetics, events, or balance tweaks) rapidly.
+  - Serve assets reliably across regions with low latency and high cache-hit rates.
+  - Support experimentation (A/B testing), rollbacks, and staged rollouts.
+  - Enforce content integrity and protect paid or licensed assets.
+
+## High-Level Architecture
+
+1. **Authoring & Build Stage**
+   - Artists and designers produce Unity assets that are grouped into Addressables or AssetBundles.
+   - A build pipeline (for example, GitHub Actions or Jenkins) exports bundles and their metadata.
+   - Versioned bundles are uploaded to an **Asset Bucket** (Amazon S3) while manifest data is written to DynamoDB or stored as versioned JSON files.
+
+2. **Content Delivery**
+   - **AWS CloudFront** retrieves bundles from the S3 origin and provides global edge caching.
+   - A **custom CDN layer** or reverse proxy fronts CloudFront to supply bespoke routing, regional overrides, authentication, and analytics.
+
+3. **Runtime Consumption (Unity Client)**
+   - The client retrieves a remote manifest from the CDN that lists bundle versions, hashes, and URLs.
+   - Missing or outdated bundles are downloaded through `UnityWebRequest` or the Addressables Remote Catalog workflow and cached locally.
+   - Integrity checks verify bundle hashes before loading.
+
+4. **Operational Support**
+   - Monitoring uses CloudWatch, S3/CloudFront logs, and CDN analytics.
+   - CI/CD orchestration automates bundle builds, manifest publication, release toggles, and rollbacks.
+
+## Implementation Pattern
+
+### 1. Asset Build Pipeline
+- Organize assets into **AssetBundle groups** with Addressables.
+- Execute build scripts (for example, `AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent()`) in CI/CD.
+- After building, upload bundles and catalog files (such as `catalog.json` and hash files) to S3 with versioned prefixes (for example, `s3://game-assets/live/v2024.09.01/`).
+- Produce a `manifest.json` that captures bundle names, sizes, hashes (CRC or SHA256), dependencies, signed CDN URLs or relative paths, target platforms, and minimum client versions.
+
+### 2. AWS Infrastructure
+- **S3 Bucket**: Enable versioning, separate staging and production prefixes, and restrict access to pipeline roles.
+- **CloudFront Distribution**:
+  - Origin: S3.
+  - Cache policy: long TTL, forward query strings for signed URLs, enable GZip/Brotli.
+  - Optionally require signed URLs or Origin Access Control for restricted assets.
+- **Custom CDN Layer**:
+  - Place a reverse proxy or partner CDN in front of CloudFront for fine-grained routing, WAF policies, and analytics.
+  - Optionally incorporate API Gateway/Lambda to mint signed URLs or tokens.
+
+### 3. Unity Client Integration
+- **Bootstrap Loader**:
+  - On startup, fetch the remote manifest (for example, `https://cdn.example.com/live/manifest.json`).
+  - Compare manifest versions with the local cache to determine downloads or evictions.
+- **Downloader**:
+  - Use `UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle()` to stream bundles, then store them under `Application.persistentDataPath`.
+  - Maintain a local index that maps bundle hashes to file paths for reuse across sessions.
+- **Integrity & Security**:
+  - Validate hashes before loading bundles.
+  - Optionally encrypt bundles (for example, AES) and manage keys via AWS Secrets Manager or Cognito-issued tokens.
+- **Load Flow**:
+  1. Load the remote catalog or manifest.
+  2. Download required bundles asynchronously.
+  3. Update the local index and instantiate assets using Addressables (`Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<T>(key)`).
+
+### 4. Versioning & Rollouts
+- Retain multiple manifest versions (for example, `v2024.09.01`, `v2024.09.05`).
+- Use feature flags or manifest metadata to toggle content for player segments.
+- Roll back by pointing the CDN alias or manifest URL to the previous version.
+
+### 5. Operations & Monitoring
+- Enable CloudFront and S3 access logs; aggregate with AWS Athena for usage metrics.
+- Track CDN hit/miss ratios, bandwidth per region, and latency.
+- Configure CloudWatch alarms for error spikes or unusual latency and monitor AWS Cost Explorer for bandwidth costs.
+
+## Implementation Steps Summary
+
+1. **Set up infrastructure**
+   - Create S3 buckets (for example, `game-assets-staging`, `game-assets-prod`).
+   - Configure IAM roles for CI/CD and read-only distribution.
+   - Create CloudFront distributions and wire DNS so the custom CDN fronts CloudFront.
+
+2. **Automate asset builds**
+   - Script Unity CI using `-batchmode -executeMethod BuildScript.BuildAddressables`.
+   - Upload outputs (`bundles/`, `catalog.json`, `hash.json`, `manifest.json`) to versioned S3 paths.
+   - Invalidate or version CloudFront caches when manifest pointers change.
+
+3. **Publish manifest**
+   - Update a stable pointer (for example, `live/manifest.json`) to reference the latest version manifest.
+   - Optionally sign manifest URLs with short-lived tokens for secure clients.
+
+4. **Client code**
+   - Implement `AssetManifestManager` to fetch and parse the manifest.
+   - Implement `AssetCacheManager` to download, store, hash-check, and evict bundles.
+   - Integrate with Addressables or a custom loader to load assets on demand.
+
+5. **Testing**
+   - Host manifests and bundles locally during development to simulate CDN behavior.
+   - Write automated tests that cover manifest parsing, bundle downloads, hash validation, and fallback logic.
+   - Load-test the CDN to validate concurrency and throughput targets.
+
+6. **Deployment & Lifecycle**
+   - Stage new content under a staging path and run QA builds pointed to staging manifests.
+   - Promote content by updating the CDN alias or copying manifests into the live path.
+   - Monitor post-release metrics and roll back quickly if anomalies appear.
+
+## Additional Considerations
+
+- **Cache Busting**: Use content-based hashes in bundle filenames to prevent stale caches.
+- **Offline Support**: Ship a minimal offline manifest with the game for initial boot scenarios.
+- **Compliance**: Sanitize or anonymize access logs to meet GDPR/CCPA requirements.
+- **Disaster Recovery**: Replicate S3 buckets across regions and configure multi-CDN routing (for example, Route53 latency-based routing).
+- **Cost Optimization**: Compress bundles, enable CloudFront tiered caching, and tune TTLs to minimize origin fetches.
+- **Security**: Require signed URLs or JWT tokens and rotate signing keys regularly.
+- **Tooling**: Provide dashboards for content teams to inspect manifest entries, bundle sizes, and release status.
