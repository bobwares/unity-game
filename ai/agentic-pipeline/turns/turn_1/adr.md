# Architecture Decision Record

Document Remote Asset Loading Pattern

**Turn**: 1

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-10-18 - 16:11 UTC

**Context**
We need to capture a repeatable approach for delivering large, frequently changing Unity game assets from remote infrastructure without shipping a full client update.

**Options Considered**
- Store the pattern only in conversational history without repository documentation.
- Create a concise markdown guide inside the project's docs directory summarizing the recommended architecture and workflow.

**Decision**
Create a dedicated markdown document under `docs/` that records the CDN-backed remote asset loading architecture, ensuring the guidance is versioned with the project and accessible to collaborators.

**Result**
Added `docs/remote-asset-loading-pattern.md` describing use cases, architecture, implementation steps, operations, and considerations for the pattern.

**Consequences**
- Positive: Team members have a discoverable, version-controlled reference for implementing remote asset delivery.
- Positive: The pattern can evolve alongside future Unity tooling or infrastructure changes via pull requests.
- Negative: Documentation must be maintained to stay aligned with future implementation details.
