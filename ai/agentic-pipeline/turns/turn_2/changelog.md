# Turn: 2 â€“ 2025-10-18 - 20:09:39 UTC

## Prompt
Create a detailed paper on Unity Addressables. Create the ubiquitous language and define the domain. Do not use abbreviations unless they have already been defined in the ubiquitous language. If you do update the ubiquitous language. Document that build pipeline for addressables from the design studio to the CDN. Take into account environments - dev-stage-prod. CDN will be hosted on AWS. Document how a game app will access the Unity Addressable during game initialization and game play. This is a level 5 document not a bullet point summary. Thoroughly explain each topic and give examples.
