# Architecture Decision Record

Unity Addressables Documentation Scope

**Turn**: 2

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-10-18 - 20:09

**Context**
The user requested a comprehensive Unity Addressables paper detailing domain concepts, AWS-based distribution pipelines, and runtime usage. The decision centered on whether to provide a brief overview or produce an in-depth, structured domain document.

**Options Considered**
1. Deliver a short summary focusing on bullet lists and high-level notes.
2. Produce a level 5 narrative document that defines a ubiquitous language, maps pipelines end-to-end, and illustrates runtime flows with examples.

**Decision**
Follow option 2 and craft a detailed narrative paper. This aligns with the pattern expectations for Unity projects that emphasize thorough documentation and supports future technical discussions across teams by establishing shared terminology and process clarity.

**Result**
Created `docs/unity-addressables-paper.md` covering ubiquitous language, domain overview, pipeline governance, environment strategy, AWS CDN architecture, initialization flow, and gameplay integration.

**Consequences**
- Positive: Teams gain a single authoritative reference for Addressables workflows, reducing miscommunication across departments.
- Negative: The longer document requires periodic maintenance to stay accurate as tooling or infrastructure evolves.
